# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Fine-Tuned Transformer Models

This project focuses on building an NLP model that accurately detects sentiment in text — classifying it as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
Using Hugging Face's Transformers library, we fine-tuned a pre-trained model for high-performance sentiment classification.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 📌 **Objective:** Develop a sentiment analysis model using state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture.
- 🤖 **Model:** Fine-tuned pre-trained transformer (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) for sentiment classification.
- 📊 **Dataset:** Custom labeled dataset for sentiment (or you can plug in your own).
- 🧪 **Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance tracking.
- 💾 **Model Format:** Saved as `.safetensors` for security and optimized loading.
